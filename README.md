# Crypto Widget

Problem:  Build a Ticker Widget in Next.js which shows latest crypto data and is embedded inside a article.

- Hello Article Starting (CRYPTO: BTC) Hello Ending Article.In the above example the (CRYPTO: BTC) text is changed on page load to a button, and when we mouseover it, it shows a popup with data and small chart (see the attached Image below).You can use any free crypto api like CoinGecko etc.
